### Tips
- Strong knowledge of basics to provide value fast
- Build my own methodology
- Ethical and legal considerations are crucial, OSINT and info gathering are OK (provided sources are public),
scanning is not
- Reinforce skills with bug bounty work
- Always get a copy of the signed scope of work/contract and a formal doc listing the scope of testing (URLs,
IP addresses, CIDR network ranges, wireless SSIDs, facilities for physical assessments, lists of emails and
phone numbers for social engineering engagements) signed by the client!
- If additional items are added to the scope get it in writing!
- Do no harm, always get written consent when performing any actions that may impact the client's network or
services
- Document, document, document
- When in doubt document and overcommunicate
- After this path specialize in one subject while continuing to build skills in all areas to become as 
well-rounded as possible

## 1. Pre-Engagement

Commitments, tasks, scope, limitations and related agreements are documented. Contracts are drawn up and 
essential information is exchanged.

## 2. Information Gathering

Gather information on the target(s) through scanning, walking the application, OSINT, etc.

**Notes**

- Keep detailed notes and be thorough when gathering information, don't skip steps and jump to attempting 
exploitation!
- Patience and organization are critical.
- Enumeration is key
- Manual enumeration is critical
